# LeetCode Solutions

Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

These are my LeetCode solutions. I followed the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)  to gain a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures step by step. I organized the solutions into folders, each representing a topic in NeetCode. Each solution is in a separate file named after the corresponding LeetCode problem number. All solutions are written in Python.

To make a new solution file, simply copy the `template.py` with this command:
```bash
cp template.py topic/00-problem-name.py
```
